#War Rhetoric in Non-Governmental Discourse

This project examines the rhetoric surrounding the "War on Terror" and traces the extent to which that rhetoric has been adopted in non-governmental discourse. By mining the texts produced by the premiers of United States and the United Kingdoms (from the Bush and Blair administrations to the present), we will identify keywords that define each realm of communication, focusing on terms “terrorism,” "security," "protection" and their stem words, which have defined the many American wars of the century so far. We will mark the relative frequency of these terms, the terms that are covariant with them, and their context within the larger discourse. This rhetorical analysis will happen in two parallel parts. In the first part, Phillip R. Polefrone will show how the textual material was selected and obtained using Python-driven web scraping techniques, then perform quantitative analysis on the selected corpus using TAPoR, Voyant Tools and NVivo to characterize the rhetoric of the Bush administration versus the Obama administration. In the second part, May Hany El Maraashly will trace the way the "War on Terror" was discussed in social media during the same period, considering the terms used and the broader trends in the discourse. Our expectation is that these examinations will show a parallelism between the terms established by the American government and the discussion in the public sphere.
